DESCRIPTION
===========

The _msgpack_ package is a pure Tcl implementation the MessagePack object
serialization library. You can find the wrapper code at GitHub:
<URL:https://github.com/jdc8/msgpack>. MessagePack can be found at
<URL:http://msgpack.org/>.

Use this documentation in combination with the MessagePack documentation for
more details.

Packer class
============

    msgpack::packer new

        _oo::class_ <URL:http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TclCmd/class.htm>
        implementing the MessagePack packing.

    packerObject data

        Return the packed data.

    packerObject destroy

        Destroy the packer object.

    packerObject pack args

        Pack the specified value and store it internally. More information on
        how to specify values to be packed can be found in section -> Pack
        options. To get the packed data, use the data method.

    packerObject reset

        Reset the packer.

Unpacker class
==============

    msgpack::unpacker new

        _oo::class_ <URL:http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TclCmd/class.htm>
        implementing the MessagePack unpacking.

    unpackerObject destroy

        Destroy the unpacker object.

    unpackerObject unpack_stream istream callback

        Unpack data read from the istream argument. The callback command is
        called when a MessagePack object is unpacked. Before calling the
        callback command, the word _data_ and the unpacked MessagePack object is
        _lappend_-ed to the command. When the stream is closed (_eof_ detected),
        the callback command is called with the word _eof_ and the stream handle
        _lappend_-ed.

        The istream is configure like this:

        *   Non blocking

        *   Unbuffered

        *   Translation _binary_

        Encoding _binary_

        Opening and closing the istream is the responsability of the script
        calling the unpack_stream method.

    unpackerObject unpack_string istring ?callback?

        Unpack the specified data. If no callback command is specified, a list
        with unpacked type (see below) and value pairs is returned. If a
        callback command is specified, this command is called when a MessagePack
        object is unpacked. Before calling the callback command, the word _data_
        and the unpacked MessagePack object is _lappend_-ed to the command.

Type information found in the unpacked MessagePack objects can be one of the
following:

    nil

    boolean

    integer

    double

    raw

    array

    map

Values can be nested type/value list.

Utilities
=========

    msgpack array2list

        Convert a MessagePack array as retuned by the unpack command or method
        into a Tcl list.

    msgpack map2array

        Convert a MessagePack map as retuned by the unpack command or method
        into a Tcl array.

    msgpack map2dict

        Convert a MessagePack map as retuned by the unpack command or method
        into a Tcl dict.

    msgpack pack args

        Pack the specified value. The packed value is returned. More information
        on how to specify values to be packed can be found in section -> Pack
        options.

    msgpack unpack string

        Unpack the specified data. A list with unpacked type (see -> Unpacker
        class) and value pairs is returned.

Pack options
============

The arguments for the pack command or method are always one or more type
specifiers and if needed a value. The list below shows the supported types:

    array size

        Add array size to packed data. Must be followed by size calls to method
        pack to add the array elements to the packed data.

    boolean data

        Add a boolean to the packed data. Is equivalent calling methods pack
        true or pack false.

    dict keyType valueType dictionaryValue

        Add a dict to the packed data. This is equivalent to calling method pack
        map with the dict size as argument, followed by calling method pack
        keyType and method pack valueType for each key/value pair in the dict.

    double data

        Add a double to the packed data.

    false

        Add a boolean with value false to the packed data.

    fix_int8 data

        Add an 8 bit integer to the packed data.

    fix_int16 data

        Add a 16 bit integer to the packed data.

    fix_int32 data

        Add a 32 bit integer to the packed data.

    fix_int64 data

        Add a 64 bit integer to the packed data.

    fix_uint8 data

        Add an 8 bit unsigned integer to the packed data.

    fix_uint16 data

        Add a 16 bit unsigned integer to the packed data.

    fix_uint32 data

        Add a 32 bit unsigned integer to the packed data.

    fix_uint64 data

        Add a 64 bit unsigned integer to the packed data.

    float data

        Add a float to the packed data.

    int data

        Add an integer to the packed data, let the packer choose the best
        packing.

    int8 data

        Add an 8 bit integer to the packed data, let the packer choose the best
        packing.

        packing.

    int32 data

    list elemenType list

        Add a Tcl list to the packed data. This is equivalent to calling method
        pack array with the list length as argument followed by calls to method
        pack elementType for each list element.

    long data

        Add a long integer to the packed data.

        pack raw.

    short data

        Add a short integer to the packed data.

    string string

        pack map with the array size as argument, followed by calling method
        pack keyType and method pack valueType for each key/value pair in the
        array.

    true

Examples
========

Creating a *msgpack::packer* object and packing some data:

| package require msgpack

| set p [msgpack::packer new]

| $p pack int 123456789
| $p pack string "A MessagePack example"
| $p pack dict int string {1 one 2 two}
| set packed_data [$p data]
| $p destroy

Now unpack the packed data using a *msgpack::packer* object:

| package require msgpack

| set u [msgpack::unpacker new]
| $u unpack_string $packed_data

| $u destroy

After unpacking, the following list of type/value pairs is returned by the
unpack_string method:

| {integer 123456789} {raw {A MessagePack example}} {map {{integer 1} {raw one} {integer 2} {raw two}}}

The same example using the pack utility function for packing the data:

| set packed_data ""
| append packed_data [msgpack pack int 0xFFFFFFFF]
| append packed_data [msgpack pack string "A Utility example"]
| append packed_data [msgpack pack dict int string {3 three 4 four}]

An using the unpack utility function to unpack the data:

| puts [msgpack unpack $packed_data]

After unpacking, the following list of type/value pairs is returned by the
unpack utility function:

| {integer 4294967295} {raw {A Utility example}} {map {{integer 3} {raw three} {integer 4} {raw four}}}
